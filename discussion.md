# Dicussion

This application builds on the simple Employee C.V. Management app that you can walk through building in two parts:

- [Introduction To React]()
- [Introduction To Redux]()

Or you can just have a look at this application where I discuss a number of things that are going on in this project.

## Running the app

### Requirements
* node `^4.5.0`
* npm `^3.0.0`

### Install from source

First, clone the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/justsayno/employee-cv-manager-app
cd employee-cv-manager-app
```

Then install dependencies and check to see it works

```
npm install                   # Install project dependencies
npm start                     # Compile and launch
```

If everything works you should see the following (if it doesn't  try [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):
